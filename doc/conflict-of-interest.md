# Conflicts of interest

There are certain conflict of interest conditions [on SC members](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance)
and [endorsements](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md#candidates).

In order for the EC to be able to judge whether two people have a conflict of interest, all potential sources of conflicts of interest must be disclosed.

These will be published for candidates, but will stay private for endorsers.

Potential sources of conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to employers or otherwise payers of Nix work. For candidates, this includes already finalised agreements that begin during the SC term.
